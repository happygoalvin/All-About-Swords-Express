# 1. Context

This is a custom API built for the [All-About-Swords App](https://helpful-babka-176ba5.netlify.app/) project.

The aim of the project is to build a simple CRUD application managing a list of sword information, using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)

# 2. Database Documentation

The database has two collections that are being called for the API. The first collection is a collection of all the sword info needed to display for the user to see.

The second collection is a pre-defined info of tags that the user can select.

The first collection forms the bulk of the project and fully supports CRUD operations.
