        "description":"Hyōhō Niten Ichi-ryū or Niten Ichi-ryū (二天一流)is mainly known for the two-sword—katana and wakizashi—kenjutsu techniques Musashi called Niten Ichi (二天一, 'two heavens as one') or Nitō Ichi (二刀一, 'two swords as one'). Although the samurai carried both a katana and a wakizashi, they only used the katana outdoors and the wakizashi indoors. Miyamoto Musashi, the famous samurai who wrote 'The Book of Five Rings', developed Hyoho Niten Ichi-ryu. This style's name translates to 'Two Heavens, One School' and refers to the trademark stance of both swords held above the head to attack. The swords work in a sequential rhythm; as one sword defends, the other attacks in the next step.",
